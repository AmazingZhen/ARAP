# ARAP
Implemented the essay <b>'As-Rigid-As-Possible Shape Manipulation'</b>.

## Platform and Library used
Platform : win10 64bits, VS2015
Library: glew, glfw, Eigen

## UI control
right mouse - set / remove control point (control points can only be placed at vertices)
left mouse - move control point

## Output
Something wrong when I captured this gif, the mouse position goes wrong.

Maybe I will describe this someday.
